# SpotifyServer
This is a simple spotify player, controlled via a TCP connection. It was created because I wanted to use my raspberry pi as a remote spotify player.

## API
### Queue
* `queue_uri <spotify uri>` Queue the given URI. The URI must be a valid album or track URI.
* `queue_delete <index>` **_not implemented_**
* `queue` **_not implemented_**

### Playback
* `play_next` Play the next song in the queue
* `play_prev` **_not implemented_**
* `play` **_not implemented_**
* `stop` **_not implemented_**

### Metadata
* `search <query>` Search for the given query. The result is a json object with three arrays; "artists", "albums", and "tracks", each containing up to 100 results.
* `metadata <spotify uri>` Get metadata for the given URI. **_not implemented_**
* `image <spotify  uri>` Get a base64 encoded image for the given URI. **_not implemented_**

### Responses
Responses are given as utf-8 encoded json objects, terminated with <LR><LF>. The messages will always contain a `type` field. Example response from queueing a song:
```json
{
    "type": "queue_uri",
    "success": true,
    "message": "Track added to the queue."
}
```

## Status updates.
**_not implemented_**
Once every second the server will send out status updates containing information about the current status of the player. Here's an example of a status update:
```json
{
    "type": "status",
    "status": "playing",
    "playtime": 123
}
```

# SpotifyServer
This is a simple Spotify player. It is controlled with JSON commands via a TCP socket.

## API
### Queue
#### Add an uri to the queue
```json
{
    "command": "queue_add",
    "type": "uri",
    "uri": "<spotify uri>"
}
```
#### Delete the track at index `index` from the queue
```json
{
    "command": "queue_delete",
    "index": 0
}
```
#### Move a track in the queue from index `from` to index `to`
```json
{
    "command": "queue_move",
    "from": 0,
    "to": 1
}
```
#### Get the current queue
```json
{
    "command": "queue"
}
```

### Playback
* `play_next` **_not implemented_**
* `play_prev` **_not implemented_**
* `play` **_not implemented_**
* `stop` **_not implemented_**

### Metadata
#### Search for `query`
```json
{
    "command": "search",
    "type": "<all|artist|album|track>",
    "query": "<query>",
    "user_data": "<optinal data that will be returned in the response>"
}
```
* `metadata <spotify uri>` Get metadata for the given URI. **_not implemented_**
* `image <spotify  uri>` Get a base64 encoded image for the given URI. **_not implemented_**

### Responses
Responses are given as utf-8 encoded json objects, terminated with <LR><LF>. The messages will always contain a `type` field. Example response from queueing a song:
```json
{
    "type": "queue_uri",
    "success": true,
    "message": "Track added to the queue."
}
```

## Status updates.
**_not implemented_**
Once every second the server will send out status updates containing information about the current status of the player. Here's an example of a status update:
```json
{
    "type": "status",
    "status": "playing",
    "playtime": 123
}
```

## Install instructions

### Raspberry Pi

2. Install required libraries and tools
    1. git: `sudo apt-get install git`
    2. alsa-utils: `sudo apt-get install alsa-utils`
        * To make sure that the audio-driver is loaded run `sudo modprobe snd_bcm2835`
    3. libao: `sudo apt-get install libao-dev`
    4. libspotify: Get the latest version [here](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/#download) (eabi-armv6hf architecture, tested with release 12.1.103 beta) and follow the install instructions.
    5. libevent: Get the latest 2.1 alpha [here](https://github.com/downloads/libevent/libevent/libevent-2.1.2-alpha.tar.gz) and follow the instructions.

__Possible problems:__

If you run into problems with an error message like `error while loading shared libraries: libevent-2.1.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` your library path must be updated. You can do that by adding `/usr/local/lib` to the `/etc/ld.so.conf` file and then run `sudo ldconfig`

If you have problems with stuttering playback or other similar audio problems, try installing PulseAudio; `sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev`
